\chapter{Configuration Basics}
Command Line Interface (CLI) is the preferred way to manage Vyatta. Its concepts are inspired by Juniper Networks
JunOS CLI, but commands are not the same.

Vyatta configuration is hierarchical, therefore commands to manage it are multiword, starting with operation name 
(e.g. set or delete) and ending with configuration path, like ``\command{set interfaces ethernet eth0 disable}''.

There are two CLI modes: \term{operational mode} and \term{configuration mode}. Operational mode is what you enter right after
you logged in. It is intended for system maintenance operations, like upgrade, reboot or shutdown. You also may view
many parameters and services status from it, like DHCP leases or active VPN sessions. But you can not change system
configuration from this mode, it can be done from configuration mode only.

\section{Vyatta Configuration Flow}
There are three stages in Vyatta configuration life cycly.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Working (active) configuration --- this is configuration made by user from running configuration.
 \item Running configuration -- this is configuration actually used by Vyatta.
 \item Saved configuration -- a running configuration saved to a file.
\end{enumerate}
The following figure illustrates it:
\begin{figure}[hc]
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/configuration_flow}
   \caption{Vyatta configuration flow}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

When you are entering configuration mode (see below), running configuration is copied to your working
configuration. After you activated your changes, they are applied to running configuration. And if your
saving configuration to file, running configuration is saved.

\section{Recipe: Enter and Exit Configuration Mode}
\problem{You want to make changes in configuration.}
\solution
Before making changes to configuration, you should enter configuration mode. To enter configuration mode, 
you should issue ``\command{configure}'' command. Configuration mode command prompt is
different and ends with ``\console{\#}''. Like ``\console{vyatta@vyatta\#}''. To get back from configuration
mode to operational, use ``\command{exit}'' command.
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta:~$ configure 
[edit]
vyatta@vyatta# exit
exit
vyatta@vyatta:~$ 
\end{verbatim}

Command set is different in operational and configuration mode, and operational commands can not be executed
``as is'' from configuration mode (and vice versa). However, there is a way not to switch between modes just to
execute an operational command.

\section{Recipe: Execute an operational command from configuration mode}
\problem{You are in configuration mode, but want to run an operational command.}
\solution
Use ``\command{run}'' command for it. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# run show system uptime 
 10:34:43 up 2 days,  8:38,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
\end{verbatim}

\section{Recipe: Edit Configuration at Some Level}
\problem{You do not want to enter full configuration path in commands.}
\solution
Vyatta allows you to switch between configuration levels to make your commands shorter. Compare the following
configuration sessions:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# set service nat rule 10 type destination 
[edit]
vyatta@vyatta# set service nat rule 10 inbound-interface eth0
[edit]
\end{verbatim}
and:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# edit service nat 
[edit service nat]
vyatta@vyatta# set rule 10 type destination 
[edit service nat]
vyatta@vyatta# set rule 10 inbound-interface eth0
[edit service nat]
\end{verbatim}
By default when you enter configuration mode, you are at the top level. By using ``\command{edit <path>}'' command,
like mentioned above ``\command{edit service nat}'' you may change the level and type commands with that level
substituted (like ``\command{set rule 10 type destination}'' instead of 
``\command{set service nat rule 10 type destination}'').

\section{Recipe: View configuration}
\problem{You want to view your configuration or its part.}
\solution
To view the configuration, use ``\command{show}'' command. It accepts configuration path as its argument, 
e.g.~``\command{show interfaces ethernet eth0}''. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# show interfaces ethernet eth0
   address dhcp
\end{verbatim}

\discussion
If your configuration was changed, and changes have not been commited yet, you will see some additional signs
before modifiyed strings. They are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item ``\console{+}'' --- means a string will be added to configuration
 \item ``\console{-}'' --- means a string will be deleted from configuration
 \item ``\console{>}'' --- means a string will be replaced in configuration
\end{itemize}
Example:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# show firewall 
   name Local {
       rule 10 {
           action accept
  -        source {
  -            address 192.0.2.0/24
  -        }
       }
   }
\end{verbatim}
From the example above we can see that strings about source are to be deleted.

\section{Recipe: Apply Configuration Changes}
\problem{You have made configuration changes and want to activate them.}
\solution
Configuration changes are not applied right after you issue commands. To apply them, you should issue 
``\command{commit}'' command. This allows you to check carefully whether all changes you made are correct, and
safely make bulk changes that would require respect to command order if changes were applied immediately
(for instance, when creating a new BGP neighbor you can be sure route-map is applied before session is initiated).
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# set system host-name router
[edit]
vyatta@vyatta# commit
[edit]
vyatta@vyatta# show system host-name 
   host-name router
[edit]
\end{verbatim}


If you changed your mind about configuration changes you have made, you can discard them with command 
``\command{discard}''.

\discussion
Note that even if all of your commands to change configuration worked propely, your commit may fail. Like this:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta# set service nat rule 10 type destination 
[edit]
vyatta@vyatta# commit
NAT configuration error: inbound-interface not specified
Commit failed
\end{verbatim}
It happens because when you are issuing commands, only separate commands syntax check is done (e.g. checking 
whether an address is a correct IP address). When commiting changes, semantics are also checked, and if your
changes do not pass it (like in example above, a destination NAT rule must have an inbound interface), you must
fix them to make them commit successfully.

\section{Recipe: Save Configuration}
\problem{You want to save your configuration for permanent use.}
\solution
To save your configuration, issue command ``\command{save}''. If no argument given, this command saves configuration
to the default file which is read at boot time. If you want to save it to some other file, give its path as
command argument, like ``\command{save config-experimental}''.

``\command{save}'' command also supports saving to TFTP, FTP or SCP~(SSH) server. Example: 
``\command{save scp://user:password@example.net/archive/config-2010.11.22.conf}''

\discussion
Configuration changes are kept only in running configuration until you saved them to file. Default configuration
file which is read at boot time is \console{/opt/vyatta/etc/config/config.boot}. It is created by 
``\command{save}'' command when it is ran with no adrgument.

If you give only a file name to that command, file will be saved also to \console{/opt/vyatta/etc/config} 
directory.

\section{Recipe: Load Configuration from file}
\problem{You want to load configuration from an existing file.}
\solution
Use command ``\command{load <file>}'' to load a configuration file.

\section{Recipe: Execute UNIX Commands}
\problem{For some reason you want to execute a UNIX command from Vyatta CLI.}
\solution
Note that Vyatta provides full UNIX environment, and you can execute ordinary UNIX commands from CLI by just typing
them. The only thing is: there is no completion for them, completion works for Vyatta commands only. 
\console{\$PATH} variable also does not contain directoried like \console{/sbin} by default.

However, when working as an administrative user, you may use a simple workaround by executing command with
``\command{sudo}''. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
vyatta@vyatta:~$ sudo ls -al ~
total 28
drwxr-xr-x 1 vyatta users 4096 Nov 19 01:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root  4096 Nov 21 08:06 ..
-rw------- 1 vyatta users 2138 Nov 21 08:08 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 vyatta users  220 Apr 10  2010 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 vyatta users 3184 Apr 10  2010 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 vyatta users  675 Apr 10  2010 .profile
drwxr-x--- 1 vyatta users 4096 Nov 19 01:56 .ssh
\end{verbatim}
